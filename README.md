## Thanks

Special thanks to the Hudder, the suckless team, and everyone else who helped me on my Linux journey.

Here's to you! 

Includes all of my config files for Suckless software, software I use in tandem with dwm (ex. lf fm), and my i3 configuration that I modified to be more dwm like with its keybindings. Fonts for dwm are included as well. 

To compile suckless programs, simply type: 

> sudo make install clean

#### Notes
1) i3 configuration is broken as of this moment, will fix later.
