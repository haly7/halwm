## Thanks

Special thanks to Hudder, the suckless team, and everyone else who helped me on my Linux journey.

Here's to you! 

#### Notes 
Includes all of my config files for Suckless software, software I use in tandem with dwm (ex. lf fm), and my i3 configuration that I modified to be more dwm like with its keybindings. Fonts for dwm are included as well. 

To compile suckless programs, simply type: 

> sudo make install clean
